This tour gets you there fast by train, and cuts the hassle of finding your own way around the sights once there. Plus, your guide provides background on the sights and Kutna’s history, and points you to a much-praised restaurant for lunch (own expense). Fares and entrance fees are included for added value. Meet your guide in central Prague and make the rail journey through Bohemia’s countryside to the UNESCO-protected town of Kutna Hora. On arrival, visit the Sedlec Ossuary—a haunting chapel decorated with more than 40,000 medieval human bones. View the strange adornments, including a bone-built chandelier, skull pyramids, and bone coats of arms as your guide explains the whys and wherefores. See Kutna’s historic mines as you uncover its silver mining heritage, and visit other must-sees, including St. Barbara’s Church, which is regarded as one of central Europe’s most stunning Gothic churches.
