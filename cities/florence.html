      <p><img src="../img/florenceriver.jpg" ref="florence river"><p><span>Guided Boat Tours:</span>Experience the unspoilt splendor of Oman’s Musandam Peninsula from the water on a full-day trip from Dubai. Travel to mountainous Musandam, a pocket-sized chunk of Oman northeast of Dubai, and settle aboard a wooden ‘dhow’ sailboat at Dibba for a 5.5-hour cruise. Then, simply sit back and drink in the gorgeous scenery and seascapes as you waft by rocky peaks, secluded coves and sandy beaches. Watch for pods of dolphins, stop to bathe or snorkel, and stay refreshed with unlimited complimentary sodas and a scrumptious Arabic buffet lunch on deck. Begin with a pickup from your Dubai hotel and hop inside your air-conditioned minivan. Then, enjoy the views as you drive to Musandam, a mountainous area of Oman on the northeast tip of the Arabian Peninsula.
      Drive through the rugged Hajar Mountains, cross the Omani border, and continue to the Dibba region, an idyllic chunk of coast lapped by the waters of the Gulf of Oman.
      Arrive in the town of Dibba, and board a double-decker Omani dhow for your cruise. Then, feast your eyes on the views as you sail along the untouched Musandam coast. Ogle the towering mountains, sea grottos and cliffs, and drift past steep-sided Zighy Bay and the secluded, palm-lined beaches of the fishing village of Haffa.
      As you sail, polish your tan on the sun deck or relax on a cool, shaded deck, keeping your eyes peeled for dolphins playing in the waters. Stay refreshed with the unlimited sodas, waters, tea and coffee available on board.
      Stop for a swim in the crystalline seas or use the supplied snorkeling equipment to discover the underwater world — the clarity of Musandam’s waters makes it a snorkeler’s dream.
      Afterward, sit down to a delicious, onboard Arabian-style buffet lunch. Dishes may vary, but expect barbecued chicken, green salads, hummus (chickpea dip), pasta and more.</p>
