        Dubai’s diverse and varied nightlife has much to offer in the late-night entertainment stakes and the Emirate regularly hosts some of the most in demand artists in the world including Solomun, David Guetta, Carl Cox or 50 Cent as well as the more underground artists that visit Dubai on a weekly basis. There is a wide range of bars and nightclubs in Dubai, but due to the various licencing laws in the UAE most of these are located inside or are connected to hotels. The legal drinking age in Dubai is 21 years of age and night clubs always adhere to this rule. For visitors, a passport is an acceptable form of ID, while for residents, an Emirates ID or a driving license will suffice. If you plan on drinking alcohol make sure you take a cab back home or wherever you plan on going after; the UAE has absolutely a zero-tolerance approach to drinking and driving and police are very vigilant; getting caught will guarantee jail time. As the regular working week starts on a Sunday and ends on a Thursday, the majority of clubs such as White Dubai, Industrial Avenue, Cavalli Club, Cirque Le Soir, VIP Room, Stereo Arcade and Blue Marlin Ibizaare at their busiest on Thursdays and Fridays. This is the case apart from the many popular hotspots that host a ladies’ night, this usually takes place on eitherTuesday or Wednesday and this will see ladies entering for free and are even offered free drinks and food. While most clubs open at around 9/10pm and typically close by 3:00am, there are certain clubs such as BASE Dubaiand White Dubaithat remain open until 4AM, this is usually as a result of a special license being granted. So, whether you’re looking to dress up for a night out at one of Dubai’s best night clubs or just a casual night out with some friends, there are plenty of party spots to pick from. Check our event section to find out the most popular and happening hotspots in Dubai each night of the week.

      <p><img src="../img/dubaiboat.jpg" ref="brooklyn bridge"><p><span>Guided Boat Tours:</span>Experience the unspoilt splendor of Oman’s Musandam Peninsula from the water on a full-day trip from Dubai. Travel to mountainous Musandam, a pocket-sized chunk of Oman northeast of Dubai, and settle aboard a wooden ‘dhow’ sailboat at Dibba for a 5.5-hour cruise. Then, simply sit back and drink in the gorgeous scenery and seascapes as you waft by rocky peaks, secluded coves and sandy beaches. Watch for pods of dolphins, stop to bathe or snorkel, and stay refreshed with unlimited complimentary sodas and a scrumptious Arabic buffet lunch on deck. Begin with a pickup from your Dubai hotel and hop inside your air-conditioned minivan. Then, enjoy the views as you drive to Musandam, a mountainous area of Oman on the northeast tip of the Arabian Peninsula.
      Drive through the rugged Hajar Mountains, cross the Omani border, and continue to the Dibba region, an idyllic chunk of coast lapped by the waters of the Gulf of Oman.
      Arrive in the town of Dibba, and board a double-decker Omani dhow for your cruise. Then, feast your eyes on the views as you sail along the untouched Musandam coast. Ogle the towering mountains, sea grottos and cliffs, and drift past steep-sided Zighy Bay and the secluded, palm-lined beaches of the fishing village of Haffa.
      As you sail, polish your tan on the sun deck or relax on a cool, shaded deck, keeping your eyes peeled for dolphins playing in the waters. Stay refreshed with the unlimited sodas, waters, tea and coffee available on board.
      Stop for a swim in the crystalline seas or use the supplied snorkeling equipment to discover the underwater world — the clarity of Musandam’s waters makes it a snorkeler’s dream.
      Afterward, sit down to a delicious, onboard Arabian-style buffet lunch. Dishes may vary, but expect barbecued chicken, green salads, hummus (chickpea dip), pasta and more.</p>
